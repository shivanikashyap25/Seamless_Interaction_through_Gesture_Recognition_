            <h1>Virtual<br><span>Calculator</span><br></h1>
            <h2>How it Recognizes Hand Gestures</h2>   
            <p class="par">Hand Landmark Detection: Mediapipeâ€™s hand tracking model detects and tracks 21 key hand landmarks in real time, enabling accurate gesture recognition.</p>
            <p class="par">Gesture Recognition: The application recognizes specific gestures by analyzing the relative positions of the hand landmarks. Each gesture corresponds to a number, mathematical operation, or function, allowing the user to input commands without physical interaction.</p>   
            <h2>Finger Gestures and Their Functions</h2>   
            <p class="par">Let us delve into the specific finger gestures and what they represent in the virtual calculator:</p>
            <h3>1.Drawing Mode (Thumb and Index Finger Up)</h3>
            <p class="par">Gesture: Raise your thumb and index finger while keeping the other fingers down.
            <p class="par">Function: This activates the drawing mode. You can draw on the virtual canvas by moving your hand, and the path of your index finger will be traced on the screen.</p>
            <p class="par">Explanation: The program checks if the thumb and index finger are up (self.fingers[0] == self.fingers[1] == 1) and ensures that only two fingers are up (sum(self.fingers) == 2).</p>
            <h2>2.Eraser Mode (Thumb and Middle Finger Up)</h2>   
            <p class="par">Gesture: Raise your thumb and middle finger while keeping the other fingers down.</p>
            <p class="par">Function: This switches to eraser mode. You can erase parts of your drawing by moving your hand over the areas you wish to remove.</p>
            <p class="par">Explanation: The program detects this gesture by checking if the thumb and middle finger are up (self.fingers[0] == self.fingers[2] == 1) with a total of two fingers raised.</p>
            <h2>3.Clear Canvas (Thumb and Pinky Finger Up)</h2>   
            <p class="par">Gesture: Raise your thumb and pinky finger while keeping the other fingers down.</p>
            <p class="par">Function: This clears the entire canvas, giving you a fresh start.</p>
            <p class="par">Explanation: The program recognizes this gesture when the thumb and pinky finger are up (self.fingers[0] == self.fingers[4] == 1) and only two fingers are raised.</p>
            <h2>4.Analyze Equation (All Fingers Up)</h2>   
            <p class="par">Gesture: Raise all five fingers.</p>
            <p class="par">Function: This triggers the analysis of the drawn equation using Google's Generative AI model. The AI interprets the mathematical expression you've drawn, solves it, and provides a step-by-step explanation.</p>
            <p class="par">Explanation: The condition sum(self.fingers) == 5 indicates that all fingers are raised.</p>
            <h2>5.Reset Drawing Points (Thumb, Index, and Middle Finger Up)</h2>   
            <p class="par">Gesture: Raise your thumb, index finger, and middle finger.</p>
            <p class="par">Function: This resets the drawing points without clearing the canvas, which can be useful if you want to reposition your hand or start a new stroke.</p>
            <p class="par">Explanation: The program checks for this gesture with self.fingers[0] == self.fingers[1] == self.fingers[2] == 1 and a total of three fingers raised.</p>
