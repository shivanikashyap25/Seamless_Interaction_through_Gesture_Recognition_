## 🚀 Welcome to **Virtual Gesture Solutions** – Where Your Hands Talk Tech

Imagine navigating your computer with nothing but your **gestures** and **voice**—no clicks, no keys, no contact. Welcome to the **next era of interaction**, designed for a world that values *accessibility, creativity,* and *seamlessness*.

### ✨ What We’ve Built
An all-in-one intelligent interface combining:

- 🖱️ **Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse**  
- ⌨️ **Virtual Keyboard with Multilingual & Voice Typing**  
- 🧮 **Smart Calculator Powered by AI**  
- 🎨 **Dynamic Drawing Canvas**  

Crafted for creators, coders, and changemakers—this platform is where **AI**, **computer vision**, and **gesture recognition** converge.


## 🔍 Why This Matters

Modern users deserve a digital environment that responds to *them*, not the other way around. Whether you’re a surgeon in a sterile room, an artist seeking a fluid sketching tool, or someone with limited mobility—this solution puts **power at your fingertips**, literally.


## 🛠️ Core Modules and Magic

### 🖱️ Virtual Mouse  
- Cursor glides as your hand moves.  
- Tap fingers for clicks, swipes for scrolls.  
- **Voice-activated system control** for fluid multitasking.  
- Gesture sensitivity customization for personalized comfort.


### ⌨️ Virtual Keyboard  
- Type by hovering and gesturing—no physical contact.  
- JSON-based layout customization & support for **regional languages**.  
- **Voice-to-text** typing for speed and ease.


### 🧮 Virtual Calculator  
- Solve basic to complex math using **finger signals**.  
- AI assistance (via **Google Generative AI**) for intelligent interpretation.  
- Accurate, efficient, and voice-enabled.


### 🎨 Virtual Canvas  
- Hand-draw without hardware.  
- Choose **colors**, **shapes**, **erasers**, and **brush sizes** using intuitive gestures.  
- Real-time gesture feedback with high FPS rendering.  
- Save or export your digital art instantly.
